I'm the Leader of Crychic Team for minecraft developing. You could call me mihono or gedwen.

Crychic is a co-creation team primarily focused on Minecraft development, dedicated to producing content that players need and love.

Currently, our projects include mod development, pack integration, server setup, and providing extensive and practical documentation for modders.

Crychic is primarily a development group serving players and creating content, while Avemujica is planned to handle internal management and operations and oversee various creative activities. This division of labor merely reflects a difference in responsibilities.

I group this team for chanllenging myself and output advanced content for the community.

If you wanna join us, pls contact with me.

I formed this team to challenge myself and deliver high-quality content to the community.

If you would like to join us, please get in touch with me.

~~It has only a name in common with the team from Bangdream.~~

我是不是客服，Crychic团队的领头人,你可以叫我客服或水獭。

Crychic是以我的世界开发为主要活动的共创团队，致力于输出玩家需要与喜爱的内容。

目前项目涵盖模组开发、整合包制作、服务端搭建，以及为魔改者提供丰富实用的文档。

Crychic是主要服务玩家与进行内容创作的开发小组；而Avemujica则在计划中担任内部管理与运营的角色，并负责各项文创活动。这种分工仅代表职责的差异。

为了挑战自我并为社区输出更优质的内容，我组建了这个团队。

如果你想加入我们，请与我联系。

~~与Bangdream中的同名团队仅有名字上的关联ですわ。~~
